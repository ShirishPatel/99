Important Note:

   If you try to show a Modal Form using the Evaluation version, the
following error will occur:
         Run-Time Error 401
     Can't show non-modal form when modal form is displayed

   This is due to the "Register" screen. So, use this Evaluation version
in a single Form or non-modal Form.
   The Registered version does not have this problem.
